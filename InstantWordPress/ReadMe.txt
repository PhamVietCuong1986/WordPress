Usage Overview: The directory called 'InstantWPBase' contains a 'blank' container of InstantWP that can be copied to local disk locations.

Important: When you start InstantWP using the InstantWP.exe application launcher, entries specific to your particular local environment are written to the following configuration files:

\iwpserver\server\Apache\conf\httpd.conf
\iwpserver\server\mysql\my.ini
\iwpserver\server\php\php.ini
